# Introduction

Welcome to the App Academy Prep Program.

This course will teach you to use the Ruby programming language to solve
problems. By the end of the course, you'll have an intermediate understanding of
Ruby, you'll be able to solve complex problems, and you'll be exceptionally
prepared to apply to App Academy.

As you proceed through the course, please code alongside our examples. In the
section below, we'll introduce you to [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby),
which we encourage you to use to start coding right away. Only reading code is
not enough to become a great programmer. Typing the code will increase your
comprehension, and mistakes will reveal weaknesses in your understanding and
improve your debugging. Bugs are software's best teachers, so please don't copy
and paste. There's no better way to learn to code than to code!

The problem sets are modeled on the questions you'll receive when you apply to
App Academy. Don't be discouraged if they're difficult. Problem solving in a
programming language is different than understanding a programming language.
Luckily you'll get plenty of practice!

All problem sets feature solutions and video walkthroughs. Redo any questions
where you made a mistake. Ensure you understand the underlying concepts and note
how we style and format our code. Proper style makes code more readable and
prevents bugs. Your final solutions should look like ours.

See you in class!

<!-- JumpStart's curriculum is split into two tracks: *the beginner track* and *the intermediate track*. You **must complete both tracks** to be eligible for admission to App Academy. Each track will take about 24 hours of work to complete. You have 3 options for completing these tracks:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 1**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *at home*, before JumpStart, and then do the intermediate track once you're here (recommended).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then return for a *second round of JumpStart* (for a total of 4 weeks) to complete the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding or are struggling with the beginner track at home.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 3**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then do the intermediate track at home. You will have to complete a Skype interview after finishing the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding, but can only commit to two weeks of JumpStart.

We highly recommend trying to complete the beginner track at home before choosing options 2 or 3. -->

# How to Use Repl.it

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/188359119?rel=0" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="line-height: 1.6em;" rel="line-height: 1.6em;"></iframe>



Navigate to [https://repl.it/languages/ruby](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) in
your browser.

The right side of the screen is the shell: a command-line interface for
providing instructions to a machine. The shell allows you to execute Ruby code
line by line. Type `puts "hello"` in the shell and press enter. Type `2 + 2` and
press enter.

The left side of the screen is a Ruby file. You can write multiple lines of code
in the file and run them all at once by clicking "run." Type `puts "hello"` in
the file. Press enter to create a new line then type `2 + 2`. Click "run."

You're now ready to code alongside our examples! You may use either the shell or
the file. Using the file may be more convenient when writing multi-line code, as
in the methods chapter.

Happy coding!

**Note:** If you choose to install Ruby on your Mac, follow [these steps][rbenv-setup].
Beware that installing Ruby can lead to unexpected obstacles. Hence we recommend
using Repl.it.

<!-- If you're doing the beginner track during JumpStart, read our [course logistics][logistics] document. -->
