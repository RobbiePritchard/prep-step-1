Hello and thank you for applying to App Academy! We're excited to help you begin
your journey as web developer.

Before we get started coding, let's take a moment to talk about the application
process. This course is designed to teach you everything you need to know to get
into App Academy. Our course is divided into two steps, and an assessment
concludes both. You must complete both steps and pass both assessments to be
considered for admission to App Academy.

When you first filled out the application on our website, we emailed you a
number of different links. One of those links is to this curriculum. Another is
an invitation to our Slack channel, which is a chatroom you can visit if you
have questions or need help from App Academy TA's. The third link is to the
online assessment, so whenever you're feeling prepared, you can follow that
third link and take the step one assessment online.

Our curriculum is filled with readings, videos, quizzes, and exercises. I highly
recommend taking notes during the readings and videos. Write code that's
unfamiliar, new methods, and a summary of each of those readings and videos.
These notes will help tremendously when you start coding.

Also be sure to type out the code for any examples in the Rep.it shell
(introduced below!). Only reading code is not enough to become a great
programmer. Typing the code will increase your comprehension, and mistakes will
reveal weaknesses in your understanding and improve your debugging. Bugs are
software's best teachers, so please don't copy and paste. There's no better way
to learn to code than to code!

When you take the quizzes, keep in mind that they're in no way attached to your
application. They're not graded. Don't fear not knowing the answer to a question
on a quiz, and if you don't know the answer to a quiz, click the explanation
button.

The most important part of this curriculum by far is the exercises. Do all the
exercises and view our solutions after you finish. When you're done coding a
solution, look at how we would solve it. By reading our solutions, you'll pick
up a number of tricks and shortcuts as well as best Ruby practices.

When you've finished our curriculum, you should take the practice assessment
several times so you feel prepared and know what to expect for the real
assessment. We've given you six, so take as many as you need.

If you get stuck or need help, please visit our Slack channel, and reach out to
your peers as well as App Academy TA's. We'd love to help you!

Good luck, future devs. Looking forward to working with you at App Academy!


<!-- JumpStart's curriculum is split into two tracks: *the beginner track* and *the intermediate track*. You **must complete both tracks** to be eligible for admission to App Academy. Each track will take about 24 hours of work to complete. You have 3 options for completing these tracks:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 1**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *at home*, before JumpStart, and then do the intermediate track once you're here (recommended).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then return for a *second round of JumpStart* (for a total of 4 weeks) to complete the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding or are struggling with the beginner track at home.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 3**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then do the intermediate track at home. You will have to complete a Skype interview after finishing the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding, but can only commit to two weeks of JumpStart.

We highly recommend trying to complete the beginner track at home before choosing options 2 or 3. -->

# How to Use Repl.it

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/188359119?rel=0" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="line-height: 1.6em;" rel="line-height: 1.6em;"></iframe>


Navigate to [https://repl.it/languages/ruby](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) in
your browser.

The right side of the screen is the shell: a command-line interface for
providing instructions to a machine. The shell allows you to execute Ruby code
line by line. Type `puts "hello"` in the shell and press enter. Type `2 + 2` and
press enter.

The left side of the screen is a Ruby file. You can write multiple lines of code
in the file and run them all at once by clicking "run." Type `puts "hello"` in
the file. Press enter to create a new line then type `2 + 2`. Click "run."

You're now ready to code alongside our examples! You may use either the shell or
the file. Using the file may be more convenient when writing multi-line code, as
in the methods chapter.

Happy coding!

**Note:** If you choose to install Ruby on your Mac, follow [these steps][rbenv-setup].
Beware that installing Ruby can lead to unexpected obstacles. Hence we recommend
using Repl.it.

<!-- If you're doing the beginner track during JumpStart, read our [course logistics][logistics] document. -->
