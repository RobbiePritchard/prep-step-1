Hello and thank you for applying to App Academy! We're excited to help you begin your journey as a web developer.

Before we get started coding, let's take a moment to talk about the application
process. This course is designed to teach you everything you need to know to get
into App Academy. Our course is divided into three steps:

  1. Step One: After you've taken this curriculum, you'll take an online coding assessment.
  2. Step Two: After passing the online assessment, you'll receive a new curriculum. When you're done, you'll have a technical interview via Skype.
  3. Step Three: You'll have a non-technical interview over Skype.

Here's how to get the most out of the curriculum:

* Type out the code for any examples in the Repl.it shell (introduced [here](how_to_repl.md)!). Only reading code is not enough to become a great programmer. Typing the code will increase your comprehension, and mistakes will reveal weaknesses in your understanding and improve your debugging. Bugs are software's best teachers, so please don't copy and paste.
* Take notes during the readings and videos.
* When you take the quizzes, keep in mind that they're in no way attached to your application and aren't not graded. Don't fear not knowing the answer to a question on a quiz, and if you don't know the answer, click the explanation button.
* Do all the exercises and view our solutions after you finish. When you're done coding a solution, look at how we would solve it. You'll pick up new tricks and shortcuts as well as Ruby best practices.
* When you've finished the curriculum, take the practice assessments several times so you feel prepared and know what to expect for the real thing. We've given you six, so take as many as you need.

Good luck, future devs. Looking forward to working with you at App Academy!
