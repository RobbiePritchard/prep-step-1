# JumpStart - Beginner Track

Welcome to JumpStart's Beginner Track! We're excited to help you begin your journey as a web developer.

<!-- JumpStart's curriculum is split into two tracks: *the beginner track* and *the intermediate track*. You **must complete both tracks** to be eligible for admission to App Academy. Each track will take about 24 hours of work to complete. You have 3 options for completing these tracks:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 1**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *at home*, before JumpStart, and then do the intermediate track once you're here (recommended).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then return for a *second round of JumpStart* (for a total of 4 weeks) to complete the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding or are struggling with the beginner track at home.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 3**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the beginner track *during JumpStart*, and then do the intermediate track at home. You will have to complete a Skype interview after finishing the intermediate track. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding, but can only commit to two weeks of JumpStart.

We highly recommend trying to complete the beginner track at home before choosing options 2 or 3. -->
