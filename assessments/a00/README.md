# Assessment 00 Instructions

**Do not share this assessment or post it publicly. We will take
violations very seriously.**

* We will take 35 minutes for this assessment.
* Start your QuickTime video recordings of both your screen and webcam before clicking 'Fork Assessment'.
* The timer will begin as soon as you Fork the repository.
* Don't worry if you can't pass every spec in the time limit; do the
  best you can.
* Instructions for each problem are included in the `lib/a00.rb` file.
  * Run the specs as you solve the assessment.
  * To run the specs, run `bundle exec rspec` from the assessment
    directory.
  * To run one specific spec, add `:line_number`, which references the
    line at the beginning or middle of a test, to the end. For example,
    `bundle exec rspec spec/a00_spec.rb:10`.
  * You will be evaluated based on the number of specs passed. It is in
    your interest to tackle easier problems first; this will help you
    pass specs earlier.
  * Look at the title of the spec to see why it failed; you can also
    read the spec code for more information.
  * Please ask TAs on Slack if you have any questions, they will let you know whether they are permitted to answer your question or not.
  * Do not use the internet or prior notes.
  * To submit:
    * `git add` and `git commit` your changes then `git push origin master`
    * This will progress you to the screencast upload barrier. Upload your screencast, then upload your webcam video and you will receive your final score.
