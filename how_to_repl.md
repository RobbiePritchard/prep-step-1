# How to Use Repl.it

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/188359119?rel=0" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="line-height: 1.6em;" rel="line-height: 1.6em;"></iframe>


Navigate to [https://repl.it/languages/ruby](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) in
your browser.

The right side of the screen is the shell: a command-line interface for
providing instructions to a machine. The shell allows you to execute Ruby code
line by line. Type `puts "hello"` in the shell and press enter. Type `2 + 2` and
press enter.

The left side of the screen is a Ruby file. You can write multiple lines of code
in the file and run them all at once by clicking "run." Type `puts "hello"` in
the file. Press enter to create a new line then type `2 + 2`. Click "run."

You're now ready to code alongside our examples! You may use either the shell or
the file. Using the file may be more convenient when writing multi-line code, as
in the methods chapter.

Happy coding!

**Note:** If you choose to install Ruby on your Mac, follow [these steps][rbenv-setup].
Beware that installing Ruby can lead to unexpected obstacles. Hence we recommend
using Repl.it.
