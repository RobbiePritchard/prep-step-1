## Course Structure

Here's what the average day will look like:

When        | What
------------|---------------------
6:30pm      | Attendance
6:30 - 7:00 | Code demo & Q/A
7:00 - 7:30 | Warm-up
7:30 - 9:30 | Independent work
9:30 +      | Homework problem

### Attendance
  We will take attendance every day; your record will be considered when making admission decisions. You **must** be present for attendance on assessment days.

### Code Demo
  During the code demo, we will demonstrate solving a challenging coding problem that was assigned as homework the night before. Here, we will focus more on problem-solving architectures and design techniques. Code demos give you the opportunity to observe how an experienced developer would approach solving problems.

### Warm-up
  You will have a different warm-up partner every day. Pairs will be assigned via email at the beginning of the day. After meeting your pair, the two of you will solve two sets of problems and answer the discussion questions together. Warm-ups allow you to practice engaging in dialogue about code. You will develop your coding vocabulary and will get better at asking the right questions.

### Independent Work
  The majority of your time in JumpStart will be spent working independently. You don't have to work alone, but you can chose how to spend your time. You may decide to write code with a partner, discuss something with your mentor, or work by yourself. The independence will allow you to go through the curriculum at your own pace, but will also require some intrinsic motivation.

  You will be grouped into pods with other students at similar levels, and each pod will have a TA mentor. You are **strongly encouraged** to discuss problems with your fellow pod members and to ask your TA mentor for help.

### Homework
  You will have one homework problem every night. If your time is limited during JumpStart, feel free do the homework problem during independent work time. Don't spend more than 20 - 30 minutes on it (unless you want to!). We'll do the problem together in class (the next day) during the code demo.

## Assessments

You will have 2 opportunities to take assessments. Both of the assessments are *opt-in*, meaning if you're not ready, you don't have to take it! Assessments are on Monday, W2D1, and Thursday, W2D4.

We have **two types of assessments:** the step 1 assessment, and the step 2 assessment. You **must pass both** in order to be admitted to App Academy. If you pass the step 1 assessment on W2D1, then you can move on to step 2! If you pass the step 2 assessment on W2D1, then you're done!

Assessments are 1 hour in length, and strictly closed-notes.

## Possible Outcomes

#### If you pass assessment 2

Your application will be forwarded to our admissions team for a final evaluation. You may be asked to participate in a non-technical phone screening.

#### If you pass assessment 1

You're half way there! You should continue to work on the step 2 curriculum at home and then schedule a Skype interview with us to take assessment 2 whenever you feel ready. Alternatively, you could return for a second round of JumpStart!

#### If you do not pass assessment 1

Not passing an assessment *will not hurt* your chances of getting into App Academy. You should continue to work on the step 1 curriculum and take our at-home assessment 1 whenever you feel ready.

## How to approach JumpStart

Everyone who clears our bar passes. There is no limit to the number of accepted students. This means you should be helping your fellow JumpStarters. **You are not competing with each other.**

You're all at different levels and will work at different paces. **Don't worry if someone moves faster than you** or solves problems faster than you. What's important is that you get the most out of this investment of your time.

Remember that passing our assessment can speed up your application process, but failing it **will not hurt your chances of getting into a/A.** Jumpstart is a small, small piece of your journey to becoming a developer. It's outcome pails in comparison to your intrinsic motivation.
