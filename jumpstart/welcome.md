# App Academy JumpStart

Welcome to the App Academy JumpStart program! We're excited to work with you in the upcoming weeks. At JumpStart, you'll have the opportunity to work through our curriculum with App Academy staff there to guide your learning. You'll also meet and work with other students at the same level as you!

We'll provide bonus supplementary material to help you solidify what you're learning:
  * Live coding demos
  * Pair programming exercises
  * Nightly homework

Check out our [Logistics Document][logistics]. **Read this thoroughly!**

As you may already know, App Academy's prep-work is split into three steps:
  * [Step 1 Curriculum][step-1]
  * [Step 2 Curriculum][step-2]
  * Step 3 - Phone Interview

You **must complete all 3 steps** to be eligible for admission to App Academy. Both curriculum steps will take about 24 hours of work to complete. Step 1 is for those completely new to programming, while Step 2 is for those that have already learned the ruby fundamentals. You have 3 options for completing these steps:

  **Option 1**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do Step 1 *at home* before JumpStart. Once you pass the Step 1 online coding assessment (which you can take at any time), you can do Step 2 once you're here (recommended). You'd conclude Step 2 with an assessment at JumpStart. You'd be at JumpStart for a total of 2 weeks.

  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the first step *during JumpStart*, take the Step 1 assessment at JumpStart, and return for a *second round of JumpStart* to complete Step 2. You'd conclude Step 2 with an assessment at App Academy. This option may be for you if you're brand new to coding or are struggling with the first step at home. You'd be at JumpStart for a total of 4 weeks.

  **Option 3**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do Step 1 *during JumpStart*, take the Step 1 assessment at JumpStart, and do Step 2 at home. You'll have to complete a technical interview via Skype after finishing Step 2. This option may be for you if you're brand new to coding, but can only commit to 2 weeks of JumpStart.

  **Note:** If you have taken our at-home coding challenge, you have already finished step 1.
