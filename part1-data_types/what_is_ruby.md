# What is Ruby?

Now that you've decided to learn Ruby, it's a good time to learn what
exactly  Ruby is. Ruby is a **programming language**, a formal computer language
designed to communicate instructions to a machine. Like natural languages,
programming languages have syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Because
computers lack the imagination to interpret ambiguity, programming languages
require greater syntactic precision to convey meaning. A computer will always do
whatever you instruct: no more, no less.

Ruby features many natural language elements and is relatively simple and easy
to use. Some might even call it  friendly. The following code snippet uses some
of the most sophisticated syntax in the language, but you can probably already
guess what it does:

Programmers use programming languages to describe and transform data. In Ruby
terms, we use **objects** to represent data and **methods** to access and alter
data. Objects are the nouns of Ruby, and methods are the verbs. Ruby classifies
objects into distinct groups known as **data types**. The most fundamental of
these are **primitive data types**.
