# What is Ruby?

Now that you've decided to learn Ruby, it's probably a good time to learn what
exactly  Ruby is. Ruby is a high-level, object-oriented **programming
language**, a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a
machine. Like natural languages, programming languages have syntax (form) and
semantics (meaning). Because computers lack the imagination to interpret
ambiguity, programming languages require greater syntactic precision to convey
meaning. A computer will always do whatever you instruct: no more, no less.

Because Ruby abstracts away much of the complexity (e.g., memory management)
from the underlying hardware, it's known as a **high-level programming language**. Ruby
features many natural language elements and is relatively simple and easy to
use. Some might even call it  friendly. The following code snippet uses some of
the most sophisticated syntax in this course, but you can probably already guess
what it does:

```ruby
3.times do
  print "Hello, world!"
end
```

Programmers use programming languages to describe and transform data. In Ruby
terms, we use **objects** to represent data and **methods** to access and alter
data. Objects are the nouns of Ruby, and methods are the verbs. Ruby is
**object-oriented**, meaning objects form the foundation of the language. Ruby
classifies objects into distinct groups known as **data types**. The most
fundamental of these are **primitive data types**.
