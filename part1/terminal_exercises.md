# Terminal Exercises

0. Practice using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls` to explore your computer's directory structure. Enter `cd ..` until you go all the way down to the root directory, `/`. Look at the various directories that make up a Linux and OSX computer system. Don't worry, you're not going to break anything.

0. Navigate to the directory of your desktop. This is usually `~/Desktop`. Use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder on your desktop. See it appear!? (Feel free to delete it afterwards).

0. Look at the 'man pages' for one of the commands in the reading and try out some of the different options. `ls` has a ton, for example.

0. Run the last three commands you did, without typing them out.  Use the up arrow and see what happens.
