# Other Useful Methods

Strings share several other methods with arrays, such as `length`, `reverse`
(and `reverse!`), and `include?`.

## Case Manipulation

Strings feature several methods for manipulating case. The most common are
`downcase` and `upcase`. `downcase` replaces all uppercase letters with their
lowercase counterparts, and `upcase` replaces all lowercase letters with their
uppercase counterparts. Both methods do not modify the original string but have
dangerous versions.
