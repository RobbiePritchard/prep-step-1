# Glossary

* Conditional Statement - A control structure that instructs the interpreter to execute different branches of code depending on whether a condition is truthy or falsey.
* Control Flow - The order in which instructions are executed within a program.
* Control Structure - A block of code that alters the control flow based on analysis of given parameters.
* Falseyness - An object's quality of being false, even if the object is not `false`; `false` and `nil` are falsey.
* Infinite Loop - A sequence of instructions that loops endlessly.
* Loop - A control structure that instructs the Ruby interpreter to execute a section of code while a condition holds.
* Short-Circuit Evaluation - When the second operand of a logical operator is evaluated only if the first operand does not suffice to determine the value of the expression.
* Truthiness - An object's quality of being true, even if the object is not `true`; all objects except for `false` and `nil` are truthy.


## Comparison Operators

* `>` - Greater than; returns a boolean.
* `<` - Less than; returns a boolean.
* `>=` - Greater than or equal to; returns a boolean.
* `<=` - Less than or equal to; returns a boolean.
* `==` - Equal to; returns a boolean.
* `!=` - Not equal to; returns a boolean.
* `<=>` - The spaceship operator; returns -1 if less than, 0 if equal to, 1 if greater than.


## Logical Operators

* `&&` - The logical AND.
* `||` - The logical (inclusive) OR.
* `!` - The logical NOT.
