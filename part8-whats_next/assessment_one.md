# Practice Assessment One

You should take these practice coding assessments in a timed setting! They last forty-five minutes. All assessments are strictly closed-notes. That means:  

* No notes;
* No Google;
* No Ruby documentation.

Click run to test your code against the specs: successes and errors will appear in the shell. This will also print your score!  Do your best to correct any failing code before reviewing the [solutions][walkthrough_one].

You can also take the practice assessment in [JavaScript][js] or [Python][python].
