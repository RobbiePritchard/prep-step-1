# Practice Assessments

Navigate to the App Academy Admission Prep classroom in your Repl.it student
dashboard. You'll see six practice assessments: Step 1 Practice Assessment One, Step 1 Practice Assessment Two, Step 1 Practice Assessment Three, Step 1 Practice Assessment Four, Step 1 Practice Assessment Five, and Step 1 Practice Assessment Six.

**Don't confuse these practice assessments with the Step 2 Practice
**Assessments!** Those are to prepare for your final interview.

Happy solving!
