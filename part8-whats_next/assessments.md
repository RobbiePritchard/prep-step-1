# Practice Assessments

Navigate to the App Academy Admission Prep classroom in your Repl.it student
dashboard. You'll see six practice assessments: Practice Assessment One, Practice Assessment Two, Practice Assessment Three, Practice Assessment Four, Practice Assessment Five, and Practice Assessment Six.

**Don't confuse these practice assessments with the Final Practice
**Assessments!** Those are to prepare for your final interview.

Happy solving!
