Hey folks,

Great job completing the curriculum for Prep Step 1. The next step is to take
the first assessment.

As a reminder, the assessment will be forty-five minutes long, and you'll have
to answer three coding questions.

You should check your email for an invitation to complete assessment one online.

We've given you six practice assessments to prepare!

Good luck, future devs!
