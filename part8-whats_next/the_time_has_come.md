# What's Next?

Hey folks,

Great job completing the curriculum for Prep Step 1. The next step is to take
the first assessment.

As a reminder, the assessment will be forty-five minutes long, and you'll have
to answer three coding questions.

You’ve already been sent a link to take your first assessment. You can find the
link to the first assessment within the same email we sent you giving you access
to this prep work. If you cannot find that link in your previous email from App
Academy, shoot us an email at contact@appacademy.io and we’ll re-send it to you.

We've given you three practice assessments to prepare! These are very similar in
difficulty to the coding challenge.

Good luck, future devs!
